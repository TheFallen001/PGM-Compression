# PGM-Compression
One of my school end of semester project where I am supposed to compress a PGM image. 
In this project I wasn't allowed to use certain libraires such as vector or algorithm libraries and such.
Using classes was a necessary criteria.
It is a school semester project, so it doesnt use any big algorithm. If you are looking for something simple, this is it!!
